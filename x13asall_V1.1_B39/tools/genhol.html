    <p>The <span class="tt">genhol</span> utility creates holiday regressors
    using the same procedure as X-12-ARIMA uses to create regressors for the
    U. S. holidays of Easter, Labor Day, and Thanksgiving.  Separate regressors 
    can be generated for the effect in intervals before and after-holidays,
    as well as an intermediate effect around the holiday.  More than one
    holiday can be specified, and the user can center these regressors using
    either their overall means or their calendar-month means (calendar-quarter
    means in the case of regressors for modeling quarterly data or calendar-bimonthly
    means in the case of regressors for modeling bimonthly data).</p>

    <p>X-12-ARIMA commands can be generated to allow the user to easily use these
    regressors in a regARIMA model for an X-12-ARIMA run.
    For more details on specific options for user-defined regressors,
    go to the section on the <span class="tt">regression</span> spec in
    U. S. Census (2007).</p>

    <p>Holiday effects for flow and stock time series can be generated with this software.</p>
    
    <p>Files for some holidays are available from this website at the download
    section of this page. For holidays whose dates are not available,
    the user must supply an ASCII (text) file of dates.</p>
          

<h3><a id="run" name="run">Running <span class="tt">genhol</span></a></h3>

    <p>To run <span class="tt">genhol</span>, enter the following command in a (DOS) command prompt:</p>

    <p class="ttindent">genhol infile</p>

    <p>where <span class="tt">infile</span> is a file that contains options
    for <span class="tt">genhol</span>.  The general syntax of this file
    is similar to that of X-12-ARIMA's input specification file, see below:</p>

<pre>
    spec1{
        argument = value
    }
    spec2{
        argument = value
    }
</pre>

    <p>There are two types of "specs": a <span class="tt">global</span>
    spec (to specify global options)
    and <span class="tt">holiday</span> specs
    (to specify options for each of the holidays for which 
    user-defined regressors are to be generated).  The global spec should 
    appear first in the input file.</p>

    <p>Documentation for the arguments that can be specified in the global spec 
    is given below.</p>

</table>

<p>In general, here are some guidelines for choosing which options to specify,
depending on the type of effect you wish to estimate.</p>

<ul>
    <li>To specify a regressor to estimate an effect before a holiday,
    the user must specify both the <span class="tt">begbefore</span> and
    <span class="tt">endbefore</span> arguments of the
    <span class="tt">holiday</span> spec.</li>
    
    <li>In general, -42 &le; <span class="tt">begbefore</span> &le;
    <span class="tt">endbefore</span> &lt; 0. </li>

    <li>To specify a regressor to estimate an effect after a holiday,
    the user must specify both the <span class="tt">begafter</span>
    and <span class="tt">endafter</span> arguments.</li>
    
    <li>In general, 0 &lt; <span class="tt">begafter</span> &le;
    <span class="tt">endafter</span> &le; 49. </li>

    <li>An interim regressor, using a window around a given holiday, will
    also be generated when the user specifies values for both the 
    <span class="tt">endbefore</span> and <span class="tt">begafter</span>
    arguments.  This effect will use a window that starts one position
    after the position given by <span class="tt">endbefore</span> 
    and ends one position before the position given by <span class="tt">begafter</span>.  
    There must be at least two observations in this window for the 
    interim effect regressor to be generated.</li>

    <li>If only the interim regressor is desired, the user should specify
    just the <span class="tt">begafter</span> and <span class="tt">endbefore</span>
    arguments.</li>

</ul>

<h3><a id="center" name="center">Notes on centering holiday regressors</a></h3>

    <p>For simplicity, only regressors for monthly data are discussed. The 
    quarterly and bimonthly cases are analogous. </p>

    <p>Before centering, each regressor is a 
    proportionality regressor whose value in any month is the proportion 
    of the days of the specified interval that belong to the month. 
    For example, if the interval is 10 days long and, in a certain year, 
    the first two days of the interval fall in January, then the value of 
    the uncentered regressor is 2/10 in January and 8/10 in February that 
    year. Its value in March-December is 0.</p>

    <p>Centering of the regressors is done to keep the yearly totals of
    the series obtained by removing 
    the estimated holiday effects approximately equal to the yearly totals 
    of the unadjusted data.  If centering is not done, these two totals 
    will differ by approximately the same amount each year, and user will
    conclude that combined seasonal and holiday adjustment is producing
    a biased estimate of the level of the observed series. (The bias is
    a crude estimate of what the data would be like if there were no
    holiday.) The type of holiday effect determines the type of centering.</p> 

    <p>Centering by removing the calendar-month means is appropriate for 
    holidays like Easter or the Chinese New Year whose regressors are 
    always zero in some calendar months because the holiday can occur   
    only in a few calendar months. The calendar-month-centered regressors 
    will be zero in exactly the same months as the regressor, and no 
    adjustment will be done to data from these months. Also, holiday adjustment
    does remove fixed seasonal, with the result that all such effects are
    included in the seasonal factors produced by the seasonal adjustment
    procedure.</p>

    <p>Centering by removing the overall mean is attractive for holiday 
    periods like Ramadan that move through all of the calender months 
    over time. With mean centering, the centered regressor's adjustment 
    for every month outside the specified interval in a given year always 
    has the same value and adjustment for the holiday effect has a usually
    negligible effect on the general level of the series.</p>

<h4><a id="easter2" name="easter2">Generating a 2-part Easter holiday regressor</a></h4>

<p>Zhang, McLaren, and Leung (2003) developed an alternate Easter
regressor for Australian series at the Australian Bureau of Statistics (henceforth ABS).
Their model consisted of two regressors, 
one which modeled an assumed increase in the level of the series before Good Friday,
and another to handle the period between Good Friday and Easter
Monday, a national holiday in Australia, where a decrease in level is expected.</p>

<p>This example will show how to create user-defined regressors for the 
   ABS Easter regressor.  A sample input file (<span class="tt">abseaster.inp</span>)
   is given below:</p> 

<pre>
global{
    numhol = 1
    outfile = "abseaster.dat"
    outspec = "abseaster.reg"
    first = 1990
    last = 2015
    period = 12
}
holiday1{
    name = abseaster
    begbefore = -8
    endbefore = -3
    begafter = 2
    infile = "easter500.txt"
    center = calendar
}
</pre>

<p>To run this file, enter</p>

<p class="ttindent">genhol indhol.inp</p>

    <p>This will generate two (2) holiday regressors in the file
    <span class="tt">abseaster.dat</span> - a regressor for the
    period before Good Friday, and another regressor for the period between
    Good Friday and Easter Monday, inclusive.</p>

    <p>X-12-ARIMA commands to incorporate these regressors into
    a regARIMA model will also be stored as a file named
    <span class="tt">abseaster.reg</span>.  The contents of this file
    are given below:</p>

<pre>
regression{
   user=(
    Beforeabseaster    Betweenabseaster 
   )

<h4><a id="easterstock" name="easterstock">Generating a stock Easter holiday regressor</a></h4>

<p>To generate a stock Easter regressor for another sample day,
such as the 28th day of the month,
an input file like the following is needed:</p>

<pre>
global{
    numhol = 1
    outfile = "stockeaster8d28.dat"
    outspec = "stockeaster8d28.reg"
    first = 1990
    last = 2015
    period = 12
    stockday = 28
}
holiday1{
    name = stockeaster8d28
    begbefore = -8
    endbefore = -1
    infile = "easter500.txt"
    center = calendar
}
</pre>

<h4><a id="holiday2" name="holiday2">Generating a set of regressors for more than one holiday</a></h4>

    <p>This example will create a file containing user-defined regressors
    for Chinese New Year and Idul Fitri, an Islamic holiday that marks
    the end of Ramadan.
    A sample input file (<span class="tt">indhol.inp</span>) is given below:</p>

<pre>
global{
    numhol = 2
    outfile = "indhol.dat"
    outspec = "indhol.reg"
    usergroup = yes
    chi2test = yes
}
holiday1{
    name = CNY
    begbefore = -10
    endbefore = -1
    begafter = 5
    endafter = 14
    infile = "cnyInd.dat"
    center = calendar
}
holiday2{
    name = IdulFitri
    begbefore = -42
    endbefore = -21
    begafter = 1
    endafter = 7
    infile = "IFHolInd.dat"
    center = mean
}
</pre>

<p>To run this file, enter</p>

<p class="ttindent">genhol indhol.inp</p>

    <p>This will generate six (6) holiday regressors in the file
    <span class="tt">indhol.reg</span> - three Chinese New 
    Year regressors (for before, after and intermediate holiday effects), 
    and Idul Fitri regressors (for before, after and intermediate holiday
    effects).  X-12-ARIMA commands to incorporate these regressors into
    a regARIMA model will be stored as a file named
    <span class="tt">indhol.reg</span>.
    The contents of this file are given below:</p>
    
<pre>
regression{
   user=(
    BeforeCNY    BetweenCNY    AfterCNY 
    BeforeIdulFitri    BetweenIdulFitri    AfterIdulFitri 
   )
   file="indhol.dat"
   format="datevalue"
   start=1970.1
   usertype=(
    holiday     holiday     holiday 
    holiday2    holiday2    holiday2 
   )
   chi2test=yes
}
</pre>
